# Quantum Chess - Implementation Summary

## Overview
All 5 critical GitHub issues have been systematically implemented. The server-authoritative architecture now fully supports quantum chess mechanics with proper probing, ghost handling, and castling fixes.

---

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #5: Ghost Check Detection (ALREADY CORRECT)
**Status**: ✅ Verified
- Ghost pieces CANNOT give check (by design)
- `isInCheck()` method only evaluates actual pieces on classical board
- No code changes needed; architecture is correct
- **Result**: Ghosts are properly treated as unreal threats

---

### Issue #2: Pawn Diagonal Captures on Ghost Squares
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Server rejected pawn diagonal moves to empty squares (even if opponent ghost present)

**Solution**:
- Modified `isValidPieceMove()` in `chess.ts` to accept `allowProbing` flag
- When `allowProbing=true`, pawn diagonal moves to empty squares are now legal
- Index.ts detects opponent ghosts at destination and sets `allowProbing=true`

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/server/src/chess.ts`: Updated pawn capture logic (lines 186-196)
- `apps/server/src/index.ts`: Added ghost detection before move (lines 240-242)

**Example**: White pawn at e4 can now probe f5 even if only black knight's ghost is there
- If ghost is real → capture succeeds
- If ghost is fake → pawn moves to f5, ghost collapses

---

### Issue #4: Opponent Ghost Probing (Core Mechanic)
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Only pawns could probe; other pieces couldn't move to empty ghost squares

**Solution**:
- Added `hasOpponentGhost()` method to `QuantumStateManager`
- Modified `isValidMove()` to allow ANY piece to probe opponent ghosts
- Move validation passes `allowProbing` flag based on ghost presence
- Index.ts orchestrates the full probe resolution

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/server/src/quantum-state.ts`: Added ghost detection methods (lines 147-159)
- `apps/server/src/chess.ts`: Updated move validation (lines 152-156)
- `apps/server/src/index.ts`: Added probing orchestration (lines 240-242)

**Result**:
- Bishop, rook, queen, knight can all probe opponent ghosts
- Any piece moving to opponent ghost square resolves the superposition
- True piece location revealed to attacker immediately

---

### Issue #3: Self-Ghost Collapse (Strategic Tool)
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Players couldn't collapse their own pieces' superposition

**Solution**:
- Added `getOwnGhostPiece()` method to detect own ghosts at destination
- Added `collapsePiece()` method to force collapse to true position
- Index.ts checks for own ghost after every move and collapses if present
- Opponent sees immediate collapse (piece becomes non-superposed)

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/server/src/quantum-state.ts`: Added own ghost detection and collapse (lines 161-218)
- `apps/server/src/index.ts`: Added self-ghost collapse handler (lines 263-267)

**Example**: White has superposed knight at {f3, h3}. White moves bishop to h3.
- **Result**: Knight collapses to f3, Bishop shown at h3
- **Cost**: One tempo to remove ambiguity
- **Benefit**: Can enable powerful tactical combinations

---

### Issue #1: Castling Creates Unknown Behavior
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Castled king and rook entered superposition (incorrect)

**Solution**:
- Castling is now treated as classical move (both players see exact positions)
- Force collapse for king/rook during castling
- Set `ghostPositionsForQuantum = []` to prevent superposition
- Rook moves silently without quantum state entry

**Files Changed**:
- `apps/server/src/index.ts`: Added castling collapse (lines 274-279)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
if (movingPiece.type === 'king' && Math.abs(data.to.col - data.from.col) === 2) {
  modifiedWasCapture = true;  // Force collapse
  ghostPositionsForQuantum = [];  // No ghosts
}
```

**Result**:
- Castling is visibly classical to both players
- King and rook positions always exact
- No ghost positions generated for castled pieces
- Matches quantum chess rules (castling is non-quantum)

---

## Architecture Changes

### Quantum State Manager Enhancements
Added 5 new public methods to support game mechanics:

1. **`hasOpponentGhost(position, playerColor)`** - Check if square contains opponent ghost
2. **`hasOwnGhost(position, playerColor)`** - Check if square contains own ghost
3. **`getOwnGhostPiece(position, playerColor)`** - Get which piece has ghost at position
4. **`collapsePiece(piece)`** - Force collapse of piece superposition to true location
5. All methods maintain player color separation (white sees black ghosts, vice versa)

### Move Validation Flow
```
Client sends move
    ↓
Server checks: hasOpponentGhost() → set allowProbing flag
    ↓
Chess.isValidMove(move, allowProbing)
    ↓
Piece-specific validation (allows pawn diagonal on ghost if allowProbing)
    ↓
Path clear check
    ↓
Move executes on classical board
    ↓
Check: hasOwnGhost() at destination → auto-collapse
    ↓
Check: Is castling? → force collapse king/rook
    ↓
Update quantum state with ghost positions
    ↓
Broadcast updated game state to both players
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Pawn Probing (Issue #2)
```
Setup: White pawn e4, Black knight superposed at {f5, g6}
Move: e4xf5 (pawn probes)

Case A - Ghost Real:
  → Knight actually at f5
  → Pawn captures, knight removed
  ✓ Capture succeeds

Case B - Ghost Fake:
  → Knight at g6 (ghost was illusion)
  → Pawn moves to f5, ghost collapses
  ✓ Pawn advances, truth revealed
```

### Opponent Ghost Probing (Issue #4)
```
Setup: White bishop c1, Black queen superposed at {d4, e5}
Move: Bc1-d4 (bishop probes)

Case A - Ghost Real:
  → Queen actually at d4
  → Bishop captures
  ✓ Capture succeeds

Case B - Ghost Fake:
  → Queen at e5
  → Bishop moves to d4, superposition collapses
  ✓ Bishop probes safely
```

### Self-Ghost Collapse (Issue #3)
```
Setup: White knight superposed at {f3, h3}, bishop at c1
Move: Bc1-h3 (bishop to knight's ghost)

Result:
  → Bishop occupies h3
  → Knight forced to collapse at f3
  → Black sees: Knight at f3 (non-superposed), Bishop at h3
✓ Ambiguity resolved strategically
```

### Castling Fix (Issue #1)
```
Setup: White king e1, rook h1 (normal position)
Move: Ke1-g1 (kingside castle)

Result:
  → King moves to g1
  → Rook moves to f1
  → Both pieces show exact position to both players
  → NO ghost positions generated
✓ Classical move preserved for both players
```

### Ghost Check Verification (Issue #5)
```
Setup: White king g1, Black queen superposed at {d5, d4, d3}
Ghost appears at h1 (which doesn't give check)

Move: White plays any legal move (e.g., pawn a2-a3)
✓ NOT in check; ghost doesn't create check condition
```

## Code Quality

### Type Safety
- All TypeScript types properly defined
- No `any` types used in new code
- Clear interfaces for QuantumPiece, Move, Position

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing game states continue to work
- No breaking changes to WebSocket protocol
- `allowProbing` defaults to `false` (safe)

### Performance
- O(1) ghost detection per piece type
- Collapse operations O(n) where n = number of piece instances
- No expensive iterations added to hot paths

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Not Yet Implemented (Per CHANGELOG)
- Checkmate detection
- En passant support
- Pawn promotion
- Stalemate detection
- Server-side move validation for king not in check
- Valid move highlighting (still uses client WASM)

### Architectural Notes
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Classical board on server only
2. **Quantum State Per Player**: Each player has separate quantum view of opponent
3. **No Client State**: Clients are pure view layer
4. **Full State Broadcast**: Complete state sent after every move
